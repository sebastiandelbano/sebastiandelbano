### 🛠️ Open Source Utilities
To be released on GitHub.

#### Quarto music extension.
- Converts user input in the form of an abc notation code block into a rendered
  musical score, and/or quality audio rendering. abc Code block can be
  displayed or hidden.
- Extra features: caching of outputs, KATE syntax highlighting for abc
  notation.
- Possible use cases: music theory notes, music blogs, music sheets for
  educational purposes.

#### Quarto language extension.
- Takes user input in a code block executes is and renders results (performing
  assembling, compilation and linking in the background if needed). Code can be
  displayed or hidden in quarto document.
- Current coverage: C++, Haskell, Rust, Lua, Pascal, PL/I, Algol, FORTRAN,
  COBOL, x86 Assembly. ARM Assembly, RISC-V Assembly, Lua, Go, Node.Js, and
  Kotlin.
- Also supports GNUPLOT code blocks for rendering plots (as SVG) and Manim code
  (rendered as animated GIF).
- Extra features: caching of outputs, KATE syntax highlighting when not
  natively supported, vertical guidelines for fixed format (e.g., FORTRAN and
  COBOL).
- Possible use cases: educational notes, technical blogs, documentation.
