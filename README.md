### 🛠️ Open Source Utilities
To be released on GitHub soon.

#### Quarto music extension.
- Converts user input in the form of an abc notation code block into a rendered
  musical score (SVG), and/or audio rendering (WEBM). abc code blocks can be
  displayed or hidden.
- Extra features: caching of outputs, KATE syntax highlighting for abc
  notation, professional sound rendering using *Timbres of Heaven* soundfont.
- Possible use cases: music lecture notes, music theory lessons, music sheets
  (with audio if needed), abc coding lecture notes.

#### Quarto language extension.
- Takes user input in a code block executes is and renders results (
  assembling, compilation and linking in the background as needed). Code can be
  displayed or hidden in quarto document.
- Current coverage: C++, Haskell, Rust, Lua, Pascal, PL/I, Algol, FORTRAN,
  COBOL, x86 Assembly. ARM Assembly, RISC-V Assembly, Lua, Go, Node.Js, and
  Kotlin, IBM 360/370 Assembly.
- Also supports GNUPLOT code blocks for rendering plots (as SVG) and Manim code
  (rendered as animated GIF).
- Extra features: caching of outputs, KATE syntax highlighting when not
  natively supported, vertical guidelines for fixed format languages (e.g.,
  FORTRAN and COBOL, 390 IBM Assembly).
- Possible use cases: lecture notes, technical blogs, documentation.
